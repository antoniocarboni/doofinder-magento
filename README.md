# Doofinder for Magento

[Doofinder](http://www.doofinder.com) is an excellent on-site search service that integrates in any website with very little configuration.

This extension:

- Allows you to easily populate your products to feed Doofinder with data
- Allows you to integrate the Doofinder Layer easily into your site
- Allows you to integrate the Doofinder Search with Magento's default internal search.
